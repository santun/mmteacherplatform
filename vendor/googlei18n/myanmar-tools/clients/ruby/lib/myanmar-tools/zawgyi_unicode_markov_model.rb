# A Markov model to predict whether a string is more likely Unicode or Zawgyi.

# Internally, this class maintains two Markov chains, one representing Unicode and the other
# representing Zawgyi. An input string is evaluated against both chains, and the chain that returns
# the higher probability becomes the prediction.

# A string is evaluated as a sequence of transitions between states, including transitions to
# the edges of the string. For example, the string "ABC" contains 4 transitions: NULL to A, A to B,
# B to C, and C to NULL.

# For the purposes of Unicode/Zawgyi detection, all characters are treated as the NULL state
# except for characters in the Myanmar script or characters in the Unicode whitespace range U+2000
# through U+200B.
